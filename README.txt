Impulse v1.0
============
This is Ciastex's custom Impulse car for Nitronic Rush but with some fixes - namely, correct apperance in replays and all of the crashes fixed.
Naturally, credit goes to Ciastex for the original Impulse car files.

This project is hosted at https://github.com/Crehl/Impulse


Installation
============
* Extract everything into the root of your Nitronic Rush directory (this should automatically merge the right folders together).
* If you have other custom vehicles (or a custom VehicleData/VehicleData.xml file) you should manually edit this file yourself.
* Select the Impulse from the in-game Vehicles list.
